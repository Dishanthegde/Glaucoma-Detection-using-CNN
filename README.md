# Glaucoma-Detection-using-CNN
Glaucoma detection using deep learning(cnn)
Step1:-In this project we have colleceted 3 datasets-ACRIMA,DRISTHI-GS,RIM-ONE publicly available datasets
Step2:-We have combined the three datasets and formed a Combined dataset.
Step3::-Data Augumentation is applied on Combined dataset in order to increase training data and boost the model performance.
Step4:-Combined dataset is splitted into train,test,validation data.
Step5:-Created a Keras CNN Model and trained using train data.
Step6:-Tested Model on test data and measured using accuracy,precision,recall,f1-score metrics.
